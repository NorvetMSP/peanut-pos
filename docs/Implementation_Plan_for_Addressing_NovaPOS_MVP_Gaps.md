# Implementation Plan for Addressing NovaPOS MVP Gaps

Below we present a comprehensive implementation plan to close all identified MVP gaps in dependency-aware order, covering backend Rust microservices and the React/TypeScript frontend. Each section corresponds to a confirmed gap area - Order Service, Offline-First Sync, Unified Payments & Tenders, Admin RBAC & Security, Inventory, Returns, Loyalty, and Integration Gateway - with prioritized steps, code scaffolding, and reasoning. We also include required database migrations and interface refactorings where needed. Shared concerns (idempotency, RBAC enforcement, event handling, etc.) are woven into each relevant section.

1. Order Service Enhancements (Idempotency & Data Persistence)

Gaps: The Order Service in its current form lacks request idempotency safeguards and does not persist order line-items (only totals and status). This can lead to duplicate orders if a request is retried and limits functionality like partial returns. We will address these by introducing idempotency keys and storing order items in the database.

Idempotency Key for Order Creation: We will allow the client (POS app or Integration Gateway) to send a unique idempotency_key with each new order request. The Order Service will store and check this key to prevent duplicate processing. A new database table or column will record keys of processed orders:

Migration: Add an idempotency_key column to the orders table (text, unique constraint), or create a separate order_idempotency table keyed by the combination of tenant + idempotency_key.

API: Extend the NewOrder DTO to include idempotency_key: Option<`String`> and have the /orders POST handler check for an existing order with that key before inserting. For example:

```rust
// Pseudo-code inside create_order handler
if let Some(key) = new_order.idempotency_key {
      let existing = sqlx::query_scalar!(
            "SELECT id FROM orders WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND idempotency_key = $2",
            tenant_id, key
      )
      .fetch_optional(&state.db).await?;
      if existing.is_some() {
            // Duplicate request detected - return the existing order record
            return Ok(Json(existing_order));
      }
}
// Otherwise, proceed to insert new order with idempotency_key...
```

Reasoning: This ensures that if the POS app or gateway retries a request (due to timeout or network issues), the server will safely return the already-created order instead of creating a new one. It is critical to implement this before enabling payment captures and refunds, to avoid double charges or refunds (as noted by the dependency that idempotency precedes refunds).

Persist Order Line Items: Introduce an order_items table to record each product and quantity in an order. Currently, the service only stores the order aggregate, and line items exist only in memory/events. Persisting items is needed for receipts, returns, and auditing.

Migration: Create an order_items table (order_id UUID FK, product_id UUID, quantity INT, unit_price DECIMAL, line_total DECIMAL). Alternatively, embed a JSONB items column in orders - but a separate table is more normalized and allows queries (e.g. total quantity sold per product).

Code: Modify the create_order handler to, within the same transaction, insert all line items after creating the order record. For example:

```rust
// After inserting into orders table (returning order.id):
for item in items.iter() {
      sqlx::query!(
            "INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, line_total)
             VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)",
             order_id, item.product_id, item.quantity, item.unit_price, item.line_total
      ).execute(&state.db).await?;
}
```

Also update the RefundRequest to optionally include item IDs or details for validation. Storing unit_price and line_total at time of sale ensures accurate historical data even if prices change later.

Reasoning: With stored line items, we can verify and limit refunds per item (no returning more than purchased) and generate detailed receipts. This also sets the stage for more advanced features like promotions or tax breakdowns. It slightly increases write operations, but these are acceptable in the POS context (orders are not extremely high-volume compared to reads).

Status & State Management: We will refine order status transitions to handle partial refunds and offline sync:

Define a new optional status like PARTIAL_REFUNDED for orders where only some items are returned (the current code marks any refund as REFUNDED globally). The refund handler will set status = 'REFUNDED' only if the refund covers all remaining items; otherwise, use PARTIAL_REFUNDED (and keep track of returned items via the order_items records or a returned_quantity field).

Ensure that order status moves from PENDING -> COMPLETED on payment confirmation, and handle an edge: if a payment fails, the status goes to NOT_ACCEPTED (already done in code). If a payment failure event arrives after an order was already marked completed (unlikely due to workflow), it should be ignored or logged as a warning (the current code logs a warning if an update affects 0 rows).

Mark orders created offline as COMPLETED immediately (since payment is cash or deferred) so that the POS UI considers them closed. The offline: bool flag is already recorded. We will keep these orders out of certain reports until synchronized (or mark them distinctly).

Refactor Bad Boundaries: The Order Service currently directly produces an order.completed event with full item details when an order is finalized, but it relies on an in-memory pending_orders cache for items during the payment pending phase. With order_items persisted, we can eliminate the in-memory cache and refactor so that:

On receiving a payment.completed event, the service can load the items from DB instead of the pending_orders map (which improves reliability across restarts). Likewise, if a payment.failed arrives, the order can be looked up and marked NOT_ACCEPTED in the DB, and we might not need to keep it in memory at all.

This change strengthens event handling: the service becomes idempotent in processing these Kafka events (since the DB state is the source of truth), and it avoids memory leakage or inconsistency if the service restarts with pending orders in flight.

Priority: Implementing idempotency keys and order item persistence is top priority, as these underpin reliable payment processing and refunds. They should be addressed first (after any foundational RBAC support in place) before working on refunds or complex offline logic.

1. Offline-First Synchronization Strategy

Gaps: NovaPOS promises offline-capable POS operation, but we need a robust sync mechanism for orders and data. The current state includes an offline flag on orders and an endpoint to clear offline orders, but a full offline queue and conflict resolution strategy is not yet implemented. We will build an offline queue on the frontend and a reconciliation process on re-connect.

Local Order Queue on Frontend: Enhance the POS React app to queue transactions when offline:

Use an IndexedDB or in-memory queue (with persistence in localStorage) to store order payloads that failed to send due to no connectivity. The CartContext or a new OfflineQueueContext will handle this. For example, when the user hits "Submit Sale" and the app is offline (navigator.onLine === false or a failed fetch), we enqueue the order instead of sending:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code in submitOrder function (POS OrderContext)
async function submitOrder(orderPayload): Promise<{status: string, ...}> {
      if (!navigator.onLine) {
            saveToLocalQueue(orderPayload);
            return { status: 'queued' }; // indicate queued offline
      }
      // else, send to backend normally...
}
```

Provide visual feedback: e.g., a Queued Orders banner or badge indicating how many sales are pending sync, and an "Offline Mode" indicator (the design already includes OfflineBanner and QueuedOrdersBanner components in the POS UI). This alerts cashiers and prevents duplicate entry of the same sale.

Use useSyncOnReconnect hook to listen for network reconnection and automatically retry the queue. The retryQueue() function will iterate through stored orders and attempt to POST them to the Order Service (or Integration Gateway) one by one:

```javascript
// Example of sync on reconnect
window.addEventListener('online', async () => {
      const queuedOrders = loadQueuedOrders();
      for (const order of queuedOrders) {
            try {
                  await api.post('/orders', order);
                  markOrderAsSynced(order);
            } catch (err) {
                  console.warn("Sync failed for order", order.id, err);
                  break; // stop if any fails, will retry later
            }
      }
});
```

Each successfully synced offline order can be removed from local storage (or marked synced), and the UI updated (e.g., decrement the queued counter). This hook is already scaffolded in the codebase; we will flesh out retryQueue().

Conflict Resolution & Idempotency: Offline orders raise the possibility of conflicts (e.g., the same item sold in-store offline and online simultaneously). Our strategy:

Leverage the idempotency keys: When the POS queues an offline order, it can generate a deterministic UUID (or use the local order ID) as the idempotency key for that order. When syncing, include this key so if a duplicate sync is attempted (e.g., due to a previous partial sync before a crash), the Order Service will ignore duplicates (behavior after implementing idempotency).

Inventory oversell: If an item stock runs out while offline sales are pending, those sales will still be recorded when synced. The Inventory Service will deduct stock and potentially yield a negative quantity, which triggers a low-stock alert event. For MVP, we accept this scenario with mitigation: store managers will get LowStock/OutOfStock alerts (through the Alerting mechanism) when inventory <= threshold and can reconcile manually (adjust stock or transfer inventory). This is in line with NovaPOS's design of alerting unusual inventory events rather than locking out offline sales. In future, we could enhance this by reserving some stock for online vs offline or doing first-come-first-serve allocation, but MVP will prioritize always capturing the sale and then handling inventory discrepancies via alerts.

Merge on Sync: If the same record is updated in offline mode and via cloud concurrently (less likely for orders, more likely for product updates which are usually admin-driven and online), the source of truth is the cloud. For orders, this isn't an issue (new orders append rather than update existing ones). For any offline data edits (e.g., price changes made offline vs online), we can decide that admin functions require connectivity (i.e., disallow product edits offline) in MVP to avoid complex merge logic. The offline-first scope primarily concerns selling when disconnected, which we cover.

Data Caching for Offline Use: Ensure product catalog and pricing are available offline:

The POS app should cache product data (e.g., in localStorage or IndexedDB) whenever online. We can implement a caching layer in the useProducts hook or via a service worker. For example, after fetching products from the Product Service API, save them:

```javascript
const products = await fetchAllProducts();
localStorage.setItem(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(products));
```

Then, if the device is offline, the POS loads from this cache. The code snippet in the POS app already hints at this approach: on Submit, it fetches products and if that fails (offline), it falls back to a cached product list. - We will expand this by pre-loading critical data (products, taxes, etc.) at login and whenever changes occur (the system can push a product.updated event on catalog changes, which the frontend could listen for via WebSockets or periodic polling to update the cache).

Reconciliation Logging: Implement logging on both client and server for offline sync events:

The Order Service can log when an offline order is received and insert a timestamp. We might add a column synced_at for offline orders (nullable) - when an offline order is later synced to cloud, update this field. This is not strictly necessary for functionality but helps in audit/analytics (e.g., measuring offline duration or identifying stale unsynced orders).

The POS client should mark orders as delivered/acknowledged once the server responds with success. If any offline order consistently fails to sync (e.g., due to a validation error or bug), it should alert the user or admin to resolve it (possibly by editing the order or contacting support).

Priority: Building offline sync comes after core online flows (order creation, payment) are solid. It can be implemented in parallel with integration work, but idempotency must be in place first to safely sync orders. In priority order: set up local caching (low risk), then implement queueing and sync logic, and finally test conflict scenarios. Offline capability is a key selling point, so we ensure core sales work offline by MVP launch.

1. Unified Tender & Payment Workflows

Gaps: The MVP scope calls for processing credit cards and crypto (USDC) payments, but we must ensure a unified, robust payment flow for all tender types. Currently, the handling is split: card payments are stubbed via payment-service and crypto via Coinbase integration in integration-gateway, with no unified interface for the frontend. We also need to enforce payment status resolution and idempotency to avoid double-charging, and incorporate additional tenders (cash, possibly gift cards).

Unified Payment API (Frontend): We will simplify frontend integration by having the POS call a single endpoint regardless of payment method. We choose the Integration Gateway's /payments endpoint as this unified API, since it already orchestrates between methods:

The POS Submit Sale logic will be refactored so that after creating an order (via Order Service), if the chosen payment method requires external processing ("card" or "crypto"), it calls the Integration Gateway /payments route. In practice, we can integrate this into submitOrder: the OrderContext can call a combined API that wraps both order creation and payment, or call them sequentially:

Cash Payment: If method is cash, simply call Order Service /orders with payment_method: "cash" - the Order Service immediately marks it completed (since no async payment needed). No further action required.

Card or Crypto Payment: Call Order Service /orders first with status "PENDING" (method "card"/"crypto"). Order Service returns an order ID (with status PENDING). Then call Integration Gateway /payments with { orderId, method, amount }. The Integration Gateway will handle the rest (for card: calls Payment Service; for crypto: calls Coinbase API) and return a result indicating next steps.

If the result is {status: "paid"}, it means the card was approved synchronously; the Integration Gateway already emitted a payment.completed event, and the Order Service will soon update the order to COMPLETED via Kafka. The frontend can treat the sale as finished.

If the result is {status: "pending", payment_url: ...} for crypto, the frontend should open the provided URL for the customer to complete payment (e.g., Coinbase Commerce hosted checkout). We see in the code that a payment_url is returned for crypto either via stub or real API. Our POS app will handle this by launching a new window/tab with the URL. We'll also show a "Payment Pending" indicator and wait for a confirmation:

The Integration Gateway sends a payment.completed event when Coinbase confirms the charge (via webhook), so the Order Service will mark the order completed and emit order.completed. We can make the POS listen for the order status change (e.g., poll the order status or open a WebSocket for order.completed events filtered to its tenant). Simpler: after a fixed interval or on user action, refresh the order status from the backend.

If the crypto payment fails or expires, Integration Gateway will emit a payment.failed event and the Order Service will mark the order NOT_ACCEPTED. The POS UI should then show an error and allow the cashier to attempt a different payment method for that order (possibly via a "Retry Payment" button that calls /payments again with a new method, or by canceling that order).

By funneling through one integration point, the frontend code path is cleaner and less error-prone. This unified approach also makes enforcement of idempotency and status checks easier on the server side.

Idempotent Payment Processing: The Payment workflows must be idempotent to handle network retries or duplicate events:

The Integration Gateway's /payments handler will be improved to guard against double submission. We can track in-memory or in a short-lived cache which orders have an in-progress or completed payment. For example:

```rust
let payment_set: Mutex<HashSet<Uuid>> = Mutex::new(HashSet::new());
// On entry to process_payment, if the order ID is in the set, return a 409 Conflict or the same result as last time.
// Once a payment.completed (success or failure) is sent, remove from the set.
// This prevents accidental double charges if the POS sends the request twice.
```

Alternatively (or additionally), use an idempotency key for payments: For card, the Payment Service stub could accept an idempotency_key (like transaction ID or order ID) but since we already tie to order_id which is unique, that suffices. For crypto, Coinbase API handles deduplication on their side if the same charge request is sent twice with same metadata (order_id).

Ensure exactly-once handling of Kafka events: The Order Service updating order status on payment.completed is idempotent by nature of the SQL UPDATE (setting status to COMPLETED is repeatable and doesn't double-count anything) and by removing the pending entry from memory only once. Nonetheless, we'll add a safety check: include AND status='PENDING' in the UPDATE for completed payments, so an event replay doesn't affect an already completed/refunded order (the current code checks status <> 'REFUNDED'; we will tighten that condition to status PENDING specifically).

The Integration Gateway emits payment.failed for any payment error, and Order Service already handles these idempotently (updating to NOT_ACCEPTED only if it was PENDING). We will test scenario of multiple payment.failed (should be harmless after first).

Completion and Receipt Generation: After payment success, the Order Service emits order.completed with all details and Inventory/Loyalty services consume that. The POS can now produce a receipt. We will implement a receipt printing or display mechanism:

Backend: Add an API to fetch a completed order's details (including items). The list_orders already returns basic info, but we might create /orders/{id} GET that joins with order_items to get full detail (or the Integration Gateway's external order response could be extended to include items too). This avoids the frontend having to store the order's cart items just for receipt - though currently the POS retains the cart until cleared.

Frontend: Upon order completion, navigate to a "Receipt" screen or popup showing the purchased items, total, and an indication of payment method ("Paid by Card - Approval Code XXXX" or "Paid by Cash"). For card, the approval_code (like "VAL-APPROVED-...") returned by Payment Service stub can be displayed; in a real integration, that might be the last 4 digits of card or a transaction ID.

If needed, integrate with a physical printer API or use the browser print.

Refunds and Payment Reversals: (Detailed in the Returns section below, but worth noting dependency here) A unified payment handling means we also unify refunds: the Integration Gateway or Payment Service should provide a counterpart for processing refunds in a manner similar to sales. Before implementing refunds, the above payment flow and status updates must be rock-solid. For example, a refund on a card will involve the Payment Service or gateway - we will likely add a POST /payments/refund route that takes an order_id and amount, and similarly emits a payment.completed (or a new payment.refunded) event after processing. The refund logic will mirror payment logic and use the stored transaction references. This sequencing (payments first, then refunds) is in line with the dependency that payment status resolution must precede refunds - we need complete info on the original payment to execute a refund properly.

Additional Tender Types: The system already supports cash (handled as immediate completion) and we've covered credit card and crypto. If the scope includes other tenders (e.g., gift cards or store credit), our design can extend:

Gift Cards: We could integrate a third-party gift card service or implement a simple in-house system. MVP likely defers this, but if needed, we'd add a payment method "giftcard" where process_payment calls an external API or internal service to verify and deduct the gift card balance. It would then emit payment.completed or failed accordingly. The unified structure of Integration Gateway makes it easy to plug in - e.g., add:

```rust
if req.method.eq_ignore_ascii_case("giftcard") {
      // call gift card API
      // on success or failure, emit corresponding events
}
```

Split Payments: MVP scope doesn't mention split tender, but our design can accommodate it by creating multiple payment records linked to one order. This would, however, complicate order status (perhaps "PARTIALLY_PAID"). We assume MVP doesn't require split payments for simplicity.

Priority: The unified payment flow is high priority, as it affects the user-facing checkout process and must be in place to meet the MVP requirement of card & crypto payments. After the order service changes, tackle this next: update frontend to use Integration Gateway for payments, implement the Integration Gateway card flow (which is mostly done as above), and test end-to-end with stub and sandbox APIs. Only once payments reliably update order status should we proceed to implement the refund mechanics (next section).

1. Returns & Refunds Workflow

Gaps: The design needs a clear returns/refunds workflow to handle in-store and cross-channel returns. Current implementation is minimal: the Order Service has a /orders/refund endpoint that marks an order REFUNDED and emits an order.completed event with negative totals to adjust inventory. However, it does not actually process a payment reversal (money back to customer) nor does it handle partial returns robustly. We will close these gaps by expanding the returns API, coordinating with the Payment Service, and tracking item-level returns.

Returns API & Partial Returns: We will refine the refund_order handler into a more comprehensive Returns Service or extended Order Service logic:

Allow specifying which items (and quantities) are being returned. The current RefundRequest accepts an items list and total. We will use the persisted order_items to validate this request:

For each item in the refund list, check against the original order's items how many were purchased vs. how many have already been returned. If the request exceeds the available quantity, return a 400 error (e.g., "Cannot return 3 of Item X, only 2 were sold").

Calculate the refund total server-side (to prevent tampering): sum of line_total for each returned item (we have unit prices stored). The client-supplied total in RefundRequest can be used as a sanity check but server should derive the authoritative amount.

If the refund covers all remaining items of the order, set order status to REFUNDED. If it's a partial return, set status to PARTIAL_REFUNDED (and keep the order open for potential future returns). We may also insert a record in an order_returns table or mark returned quantities in order_items.

Example code sketch:

```rust
// Pseudo-code for validating a refund request
let original_items = sqlx::query!("SELECT product_id, quantity FROM order_items WHERE order_id = $1", req.order_id).fetch_all(&db).await?;
for req_item in req.items {
      let orig = original_items.iter().find(|it| it.product_id == req_item.product_id);
      if orig.is_none() || req_item.quantity > orig.quantity - already_returned(orig.product_id) {
            return Err((StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, "Return quantity exceeds sold quantity"));
      }
}
// Compute refund_total from orig prices * quantities.
```

where already_returned(product_id) comes from tracking (maybe maintain a returned_quantity in order_items or separate returns records).

After validation, proceed to update DB:

Mark the order's status appropriately (partial or full refund).

Insert a new row in order_items or an order_returns table for each returned item (with negative quantity to record the return event, or a flag).

Note: Another approach is to not mark the order itself as refunded on partial, but just leave it as COMPLETED and rely on returns records for tracking. However, having a distinct status is useful to filter fully refunded orders out of sales metrics, etc. We'll implement PARTIAL_REFUNDED to signal an order not fully active but not completely refunded.

Coordinating Refund Payments: The act of marking an order refunded must trigger the payment reversal to the customer for electronic payments:

Card Refunds: We will extend the Payment Service to handle refunds. For MVP, since the Payment Service is currently a stub, we simulate refund by printing a message (as we do approval) and assume success. In production, this would call the payment gateway's refund API (using the saved transaction/approval code).

Add a new handler, e.g. process_refund in payment_handlers.rs, and expose it via a route /payments/refund in Payment Service. It would accept a JSON with orderId and amount (and possibly original payment method or transaction id).

For the stub, implement similarly to process_card_payment: a short delay then return a status: "refunded", refund_code: "VAL-REFUND-XYZ" or such. In real integration, use the SDK/API of the payment provider.

The Payment Service (or Integration Gateway) should then emit a payment.completed event for the refund transaction. We might introduce a new Kafka topic like payment.refunded, but to keep things simple we can reuse payment.completed with a negative amount. Indeed, the current design reuses order.completed events with negative totals for refunds. We can mirror that for payments: emit payment.completed with the same order_id and a negative amount to signify money moving in the opposite direction.

The Order Service's Kafka listener for payment.completed can then update order status if needed (though we already set it via API) - or we skip updating status on that event because the API did it. The more important consumer is the Accounting/Finance side (which might be out of MVP scope) or at least logging the refund.

Since using payment.completed for both charges and refunds could be confusing, an alternative is to include a field in the event (like evt.amount negative or an event type field). Our PaymentCompletedEvent already has an amount field, which can carry a negative value for refunds. We will adopt that convention (the Inventory Service currently ignores payment.completed events except for logging, so a negative amount in that context has no effect on inventory).

Crypto Refunds: Crypto refunds are more complex (sending crypto back to a wallet). Coinbase Commerce doesn't support automatic refunds to my knowledge; it might require manual intervention or a separate process. For MVP, we will not implement automatic crypto refunds (this can be clarified as out-of-scope or handled manually). We will, however, ensure the system allows marking an order paid by crypto as refunded in NovaPOS for record-keeping (points, inventory). The admin might then resolve the financial side externally. To set expectations, we'll note in documentation that crypto refunds aren't automated for MVP.

Cash Refunds: These are straightforward - if payment_method was "cash", marking the order refunded is enough (cash given back offline). No Payment Service call needed.

Integration Gateway Role: We have two design options for invoking the refund:

Order Service drives refund: When POST /orders/refund is called, Order Service does the DB updates and then internally calls the Payment Service (or Integration Gateway) to process the refund if it was a card/crypto transaction. This direct approach means Order Service needs to know if the original payment was card or crypto. We can store payment_method in the orders table for this purpose.

E.g., after updating order status, if order.payment_method == "card", make an HTTP call to PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL/payments/refund with order_id and amount. If payment_method == "crypto", perhaps log a warning or initiate a manual process (MVP).

Integration Gateway coordinates refund: Alternatively, we create an endpoint /external/refund on Integration Gateway which the POS or Admin Portal would call. Integration Gateway then calls Order Service for status update and Payment Service for actual refund. This keeps the Order Service simpler (it only worries about its DB) at the cost of more moving parts.

For MVP and simplicity, we lean towards the Order Service handling it directly: it already has a refund handler, so extending it is natural. It will use an internal client to call Payment Service. This also aligns with the synchronous nature of issuing a refund while the customer is present (for card, usually you'd trigger it immediately).

Code sketch within Order Service refund_order:

```rust
if updated_order.status == "REFUNDED" {
      if payment_method.eq("card") {
            client.post("{PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL}/payments/refund")
                    .json(&{ "orderId": order_id, "amount": refund_total })
                    .send().await?;
      } else if payment_method.eq("crypto") {
            // Log or handle accordingly (MVP: maybe log "Crypto refund to be handled manually")
      }
}
```

We must include auth (JWT or service-to-service token) for this call; since all services share a network, we might allow internal calls via a service JWT or an integration key.

On success of the refund Payment Service call, the Payment Service (stub) returns success and we consider the refund done. The Order Service had already marked the order REFUNDED in DB, and it also emitted an order.completed event with negative values (which Inventory Service will use to restock items and Loyalty Service will deduct points accordingly). If the payment refund fails (e.g., card network error), the Order Service should roll back the order status change and inform the caller that refund failed (so the cashier knows it didn't go through). This implies the refund operation should be transactional: update DB only after payment service confirms. In practice, we might do a best-effort: mark as refunded and then if Payment Service fails, mark it back or create an alert for reconciliation. To avoid complexity, one could process the Payment first, then update order status - but since our Payment Service stub is instantaneous, this sequencing is fine.

Inventory and Loyalty on Returns: The good news is our existing event-driven design mostly handles the effects of returns:

Inventory: The Order Service currently emits an order.completed event with negative item quantities for refunds. The Inventory Service subscribes to order.completed events and deducts inventory accordingly. With a negative quantity, the inventory update code will add to stock (because it does quantity = quantity - (negative number) = increase). This effectively restocks the returned items, as desired, and will also trigger any low-stock threshold alerts if appropriate (e.g., going from -1 back to 0 might resolve an out-of-stock, which is fine). We should verify the Inventory Service handles the insert case for returns: it attempts an UPDATE, and if the product wasn't found, inserts with default threshold. Since a product would exist from original sale, this is fine. No change needed there beyond ensuring the event is emitted.

Loyalty: The Loyalty Service listens on order.completed events and adds points for purchases. We have implemented that a negative total leads to a negative points delta, thereby subtracting points on a refund. This satisfies the basic requirement that customers don't keep points for returned purchases. We will double-check that partial refunds subtract only the appropriate points (since our event's total will equal the refund amount as a negative). With our updated refund logic, we'll ensure the order.completed (refund) event's total equals the refunded amount (and items list corresponds), which our implementation already does. The Loyalty Service will then compute delta = floor(evt.total) which for a negative total results in negative points, and update the balance. This covers the loyalty aspect of returns without further changes.

Admin/Store Portal Interface for Returns: For cross-channel returns (e.g., customer bought online, returns in-store), the store associate or admin needs to perform the refund:

In the POS app, we should provide a "Find Order" or "Return Item" workflow where an employee can look up an order (by scanning a receipt barcode or searching by order ID/customer), then select items to return. This likely falls under the Admin Portal if returns are more centrally managed, or in the POS if store managers handle returns.

MVP Implementation: We will add a simple "Returns" page in the Admin React app (or POS app for managers) where they input an Order ID (from an email or receipt). The app calls Order Service /orders/{id} to retrieve details (including items). It then presents the items with checkboxes or quantity selectors for return. On submission, it calls the /orders/refund API with the chosen items and triggers the flow above.

Example UI flow: The cashier navigates to Returns, enters order #123, sees that order's lines: e.g., 2 x Item A, 1 x Item B. The customer is returning 1 x Item A. The cashier selects that, and clicks "Process Return". The app calls our refund API with order_id=123, items=[{product_id: A, quantity: 1}], total=X. The API processes, and the UI gets a confirmation or error to display. If payment was card, the approval may take a second; we show a loading indicator until API returns success.

We'll enforce via RBAC that only authorized roles can perform returns (likely managers or admins, not basic cashiers, depending on policy). The ORDER_REFUND_ROLES constant already lists super_admin, admin, manager which aligns with that. Our endpoint already checks these roles on the JWT.

Buy Online, Return In Store (BORIS): The architecture should allow an order placed via e-commerce (through Integration Gateway) to be refunded in-store. Since all orders (online or in-store) reside in the Order Service (tenanted by retailer), the process is the same: the store staff finds the order and invokes /orders/refund. The fact it was online doesn't change the technical process; the difference might be procedural (e.g., verifying the item is physically returned). Our design accounts for this scenario as recommended - nothing additional needed aside from training and maybe a note in documentation that online orders can be looked up by order ID or customer.

Priority: Implementing returns comes after payments. We have to have confidence in order data and payment processing to correctly reverse transactions. The steps are: 1. Extend Order Service DB (order_items, etc.) and store payment_method on orders. 2. Implement Payment Service refund logic (even if stub) and/or Integration Gateway support. 3. Update Order Service refund handler to coordinate with Payment Service and handle partial returns logic. 4. Add frontend support in admin/pos app for initiating returns. 5. Test end-to-end: full refund (card, cash, crypto) and partial refunds, ensuring inventory and loyalty adjustments happen and no double processing occurs.

This thorough approach assures stakeholders that the popular "buy online, return in store" scenario is accounted for as requested, and that refund edge cases (partial, multi-tender) won't derail the system.

1. Inventory & Product Management Improvements

Gaps: The Inventory and Product services need to handle product variants (size, color, etc.) and possibly serial number tracking to meet the MVP's goal of universal retail support. Additionally, multi-store inventory and stock transfers are in scope, and low-stock alerting must be robust. We will augment the data model and APIs accordingly, without over-complicating the services.

Product Variants Data Model: Instead of treating every variant as a separate unrelated product, we introduce a way to link variants:

Option A (simple): Add a parent_product_id field to the products table. If set, this product is a variant of the parent product. The parent product can be a "model" or base product with no specific variant attributes. For example, a T-Shirt (parent) has variants that are identical except for size/color.

Option B (explicit variants table): Create a product_variants table listing variant attributes. For MVP, Option A is sufficient and quicker:

Migration: ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN parent_id UUID NULL REFERENCES products(id);

A product with parent_id not null inherits common attributes from its parent (name, description) but can have its own price or additional attribute fields (size, color). We also add columns for those attributes if needed, e.g., size VARCHAR, color VARCHAR - or use a generic key-value JSON for attributes to avoid altering schema for each attribute type.

Usage: The Product Service's create/update APIs should accept optional variant data. For instance, when creating a new variant, the request includes parent_id of the base product and specific attribute values. The list_products endpoint should by default return all products including variants (possibly with an indicator or grouping by parent). We might also add a filter to retrieve variants of a specific parent.

Example:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct NewProduct { name: String, price: f64, parent_id: Option<Uuid>, attributes: Option<serde_json::Value>, ... }
```

If parent_id is provided, validate that such a parent exists and perhaps copy some fields or enforce some rules (e.g., a variant cannot itself have its own variants, or that parent has no parent itself to avoid deep nesting). - Reasoning: This approach addresses variant support with minimal changes, as recommended, and avoids needing a whole new microservice. It allows the MVP to handle use cases like apparel (size/color) and others without schema refactor later. By planning it now, we reduce future tech debt.

Serial Number Tracking: For retailers dealing with unique items (electronics with serials, or luxury items), we add the capacity to record serial numbers in inventory:

Migration: Create a new table inventory_serials with product_id, tenant_id, serial_number, status (status could be "IN_STOCK", "SOLD", etc.). Each inventory record (product + location) can link to multiple serial numbers here.

The Inventory Service would not enforce serials unless needed (some products might not use it). We can add an optional flag on products like track_serials BOOLEAN.

When an order.completed event comes in for a product that tracks serials, we'd expect the POS to have collected the serial number of the sold item and include it in the OrderItem data. We can extend OrderItem to have an optional serial_number field. If present, when processing order.completed, the Inventory Service will mark that serial as "SOLD" (or remove from available pool). For returns, we'd mark it back to "IN_STOCK" if returned.

This level of detail might be beyond MVP core requirements, so we implement the data model and basic API to add serials to inventory, but it can be a no-op in the normal sale flow unless explicitly used. In other words, we "lay the groundwork" for serial tracking now with minimal interference in existing flows.

Admin UI: Provide a way to input serials when receiving inventory (e.g., when adding stock of a product marked as track_serials, prompt to input/upload serial numbers). This could be as simple as a textarea where they list serials or an Excel upload - perhaps overkill for MVP, but the database and API capability will be there.

Stock Threshold & Alerts: The Inventory Service already supports low-stock thresholds per item and emits an alert event when quantity falls below threshold. We will verify and enhance:

Ensure that when a product is created, if an initial threshold isn't provided, we set a default (currently 5). This is done in handle_product_created using DEFAULT_THRESHOLD.

The alert event currently is constructed (likely topic inventory.low_stock or part of security.alerts depending on config). We should route these to a notification system:

Integration Gateway could listen for inventory.low_stock events and then either log them or forward to an external webhook/email (the config SECURITY_ALERT_TOPIC hints that integration-gateway might handle such alerts). Indeed, the Integration Gateway's alerts module could be used to send an alert (like an email or Slack) when such events occur. We'll make sure the alerts and usage components in integration-gateway are set up to catch this if configured.

Admin Portal UI can also surface low stock alerts on dashboards (e.g., show "WARNING:  Item X at Store Y is low on stock (3 left)"). This could be done by querying an Alerts service or subscribing via WebSocket. For MVP, perhaps a simple "Low Stock Items" report in the Admin UI that queries inventory table for any quantity <= threshold.

Multi-Store Inventory & Transfers: NovaPOS supports multiple locations and central control. The architecture already has tenant_id and presumably a location_id or store concept in inventory (the code shows inventory keyed by tenant and product, but not explicitly by location in the snippet - likely the inventory table has a composite PK of (product_id, tenant_id, location_id)). If not, we add location_id to inventory records to distinguish stores.

If location_id wasn't included yet, migrate to add it (and update queries accordingly). Each POS client operating offline would need to include its store ID in the requests (perhaps via the JWT claims or an X-Location-ID header). We see X-Tenant-ID being used widely for multi-tenancy; we might similarly use X-Location-ID for store context.

Stock Transfer API: Implement an endpoint to move stock between locations. This can be part of Inventory Service: POST /inventory/transfer with payload { product_id, from_location, to_location, quantity }. The handler will:

Check that both locations belong to the same tenant and the product exists in both (create inventory row for the target loc if not).

Inside a DB transaction: decrement the inventory.quantity at from_location and increment at to_location. Reject if from_location doesn't have enough stock (quantity < requested transfer qty).

Produce an event inventory.transferred with details (could be used by Analytics service to track transfers or to trigger notifications).

Possibly log into a inventory_transfer table for audit (fields: product, qty, from, to, date, user who initiated).

Admin Portal: Provide a UI for transfers (perhaps on the inventory page, select a product, pick a target store and quantity to send). This is likely an admin/manager function only.

Reasoning: This fulfills the multi-store requirement by allowing inventory balancing across stores. By using a transactional update, we keep data consistent. Permissions: enforce via RBAC that only manager/admin can transfer stock (cashiers likely shouldn't). We'll reuse the auth mechanism to check roles in this new handler.

Audit Trail for Inventory Changes: Since stock adjustments and transfers are sensitive, we should audit them:

The Product Service already has an audit route (likely logging product changes). We should ensure that whenever inventory is adjusted (sale, return, manual adjustment, or transfer), an entry is logged. Possibly the Analytics or Audit service can subscribe to inventory events for this purpose.

If an Audit Service is present (mentioned in architecture), we integrate by sending an event or making a call whenever a transfer or manual adjustment happens (e.g., "User X transferred 5 units of Product Y from Store A to B").

Priority: Inventory enhancements can be done in parallel with Payments/Returns, but should be mostly completed by the time MVP testing begins since product and stock management must be stable. The variant support and location-specific stock are structural changes, so implement those early in the development cycle (since they affect data created subsequently). Transfers can come slightly later but before MVP launch for multi-store clients to use.

These improvements ensure that NovaPOS can manage products with variants and track inventory per store, hitting the MVP scope of basic inventory with variants and multi-store support. Moreover, planning for variants/serials now prevents painful refactoring later.

1. Admin RBAC and Security Enforcement

Gaps: The architecture outlines role-based access control (RBAC) and admin controls, which are partially in place (JWTs contain roles, and handlers check roles manually). Gaps may include lack of a UI to manage roles, inconsistent enforcement across services, and missing finer-grained permissions. We will strengthen RBAC in both backend and frontend:

Consistent RBAC Checks (Backend): Ensure every sensitive operation verifies the caller's role:

Audit all service endpoints to confirm usage of role checks. For instance, Order Service uses ensure_role for create (cashier+) and refund (manager+). Inventory Service's list_inventory might allow all roles (view only) - that's fine. For product creation, likely admin only, etc.

If any service lacks checks, add them using the common pattern (e.g., define allowed roles and use AuthContext similarly). We might refactor to reduce duplication: our code has identical ensure_role and tenant_id_from_request functions in multiple services. We can move these helpers to the common_auth crate so that all services use the same implementation and role definitions.

For example, define roles constants in one place (auth service or common lib) to avoid divergence. Roles identified: "super_admin", "admin", "manager", "cashier". Possibly "employee" or others if needed.

Each microservice can have its own allowed roles per endpoint, but having a central definition of the role hierarchy (e.g., super_admin > admin > manager > cashier) helps. We'll document that hierarchy clearly.

Tenant Isolation: The middleware already checks that the X-Tenant-ID header matches the JWT's tenant claim, preventing one tenant from accessing another's data even if roles match. We'll keep this in place for all service routes (extending to any new routes we add, like inventory transfer, etc.). This is critical for multi-tenant security.

Service-to-Service Authentication: Some internal calls (Order Service calling Payment Service, etc.) may need to bypass RBAC (since they are trusted internal operations). We will either:

Use the system's JWT (maybe the auth service can issue a JWT representing an internal service role) or an integration key. For simplicity, we can configure an Integration API key that grants internal services permission to call others. For example, when Order Service calls Payment Service for a refund, it includes an X-API-Key header with a secret that Integration Gateway/Payment Service recognizes as internal. This prevents an external actor from invoking those endpoints without proper auth.

Since the Integration Gateway already implements an API key check, we could register an internal key in the Auth Service (via create_integration_key API for the appropriate tenant or a special tenant) to use.

Document these internal keys in Vault or config so they are not exposed.

Frontend Role Enforcement: The Admin Portal and POS UI must hide or disable actions the current user role should not perform:

Cashier vs Manager vs Admin:

A cashier should not see admin settings like user management, nor perform refunds or price overrides without permission.

A manager might handle returns and view reports but perhaps not manage tenant-wide settings.

An admin (corporate) can do everything including manage users, products, etc.

We will use the user's JWT (already stored after login) to determine role on the client. The React contexts (AuthContext) can expose currentUser.roles.

Implement conditional rendering or route protection:

For example, wrap admin-only pages (like User Management, Integrations, Analytics settings) in a check:

```javascript
if (!user.roles.includes('admin') && !user.roles.includes('super_admin')) {
      return UnauthorizedPage;
}
```

Or use React Router to restrict certain routes.

In components, e.g., on the POS interface, hide the "Refund" button if the user isn't manager+:

```javascript
{user.roles.some(r => ['manager','admin','super_admin'].includes(r)) && (
      openRefundDialog(); // Refund
)}
```

Similarly, prevent access to price editing, inventory adjustments, etc., based on roles.

The Admin Portal will have a navigation menu where items shown depend on role. For instance, only admins see "User Management" or "Integration Settings".

MFA Enforcement: The scope mentioned MFA for admin users. The Auth Service has endpoints for MFA enroll/verify. We should ensure the Admin Portal UI triggers these for new admin accounts (perhaps prompt them to enroll a device). This could be a post-login step for users with roles requiring MFA (the Auth service config require_mfa likely controls this). Detailing MFA is perhaps beyond this task, but mention that privileged actions may require re-auth/MFA if configured.

User Management UI: Provide a section in Admin Portal to manage employees (users) and roles:

The Auth Service already provides POST /users to create a user and GET /roles to list available roles. We will create a simple form for admins to add a user: enter email, name, initial role, etc. The request goes to Auth Service /users.

Possibly allow updating a user's role or disabling a user. We don't see an explicit update endpoint, but we might implement one (e.g., PUT /users/:id to change role, or re-use create to invite a new user).

The list_users endpoint exists, so we can populate a table of current users and their roles. Add controls to remove or change roles (if needed, a simple approach: perhaps require deleting and re-adding if role changes are infrequent, or implement a small endpoint for role update).

Ensure that only tenant admins (or super_admin) can access this page and call these APIs (the Auth service will enforce via roles anyway with required roles likely admin-only for creating users).

Tenant vs Platform Admin: It's implied NovaPOS might have a super_admin at the platform level and admin per tenant. The Auth service seems to support multi-tenant by the tenant_id in JWT and separate tenant creation. Our UI should make clear distinction if needed (for MVP, probably one tenant so not an issue).

Audit Logging of Admin Actions: Key admin actions (user creation, role changes, deleting data, refunds, etc.) should produce audit logs. The Auth service likely logs logins and maybe uses Kafka for security events (MFA activities, etc.). We will ensure:

User management actions trigger logs: e.g., after a successful create_user, Auth Service could emit an event or at least log to console (which we will capture in monitoring).

Refunds and transfers (as discussed) will be logged.

If an Audit microservice is available, integrate by sending it events. If not, use existing metrics/logging.

PCI Compliance basics: Ensuring card data isn't stored (we currently do not store PAN, only perhaps an approval code - that's fine). All communication is TLS (implied by infrastructure). We should ensure to mask sensitive info in logs (e.g., if we ever log a bearer token or key, avoid that in production) and encrypt any sensitive fields in the DB:

The Customer Service is already encrypting PII (email, phone) with a master key, which is great for GDPR. We should extend similar caution to any secret keys we store (integration keys are hashed in DB as we saw).

We will document that by MVP launch we aim for PCI SAQ-A or C, meaning we either outsource payment processing or minimize card data handling - which we do by using external gateways and not storing card numbers.

Priority: RBAC enforcement is foundational and should be implemented early, before broad testing. We should not defer this, as security can't be an afterthought. The Admin Portal user management can be implemented after core flows (since it's slightly less critical than being able to sell/return items), but certainly must be done by MVP release to allow the business to manage access.

By solidifying RBAC, we meet the MVP requirement of basic user management & security and ensure that our earlier features (refunds, transfers, etc.) are only executed by appropriate roles. This reduces risk in production and builds stakeholder confidence in the system's security approach.

1. Loyalty Program Integration

Gaps: The MVP scope includes a basic customer loyalty mechanism, but the original architecture left details sparse. We have since created a Loyalty Service that accrues points on purchase events, but we need to ensure it's fully integrated end-to-end: from capturing customer info at checkout, to displaying point balances in POS/Admin, and laying groundwork for redemption.

Customer Association with Orders: The POS app should allow attaching a customer to an order (e.g., the shopper's loyalty account). The Order Service already accepts an optional customer_id in the order payload. The frontend needs to provide a way to select or input the customer:

Implement a "Lookup Customer" feature in the POS. This could be as simple as a text box or scanner input for a loyalty card/phone number. The POS can call Customer Service's search API (we have GET /customers?q=... which searches by name, email, phone with hashing for privacy). Show matching customers to select, or allow creating a new customer on the fly (via POST /customers).

Once a customer is selected, store it in the Cart context and include the customer_id in the NewOrder when submitting. This ensures the order is linked. The Order Service will persist it (and it's included in events).

If no customer is attached, that's fine (loyalty points just won't be recorded for that sale).

Loyalty Points Accrual: The Loyalty Service is set up to handle order.completed events:

It calculates points = floor(total) and updates loyalty_points table. We should confirm the points earning rate - currently 1 point per $1 (floor) as per requirements. If we want configurability per tenant, we can add a multiplier setting in a config table, but MVP can hardcode or have a simple config in the loyalty service (e.g., an environment variable defaulting to 1 point/$1).

It emits a loyalty.updated event with the new balance. We can use this in the future to trigger notifications ("You earned 50 points!") or update a dashboard in real-time.

Displaying Loyalty Info (Frontend):

POS UI: After an order with a customer is completed, show the points earned on the receipt or confirmation screen ("You earned 50 points this purchase. Total points: 200"). Since the Loyalty Service updates asynchronously, the POS could call the Loyalty Service's GET /points?customer_id= endpoint to fetch the latest total when printing the receipt. The loyalty service has get_points implemented. Alternatively, use the response from loyalty.updated event if we set up a subscription.

Also, when a customer is selected for the transaction, the POS could display their current points balance (by querying the same API at selection time). This motivates staff to mention "you have X points".

Admin Portal: Add a Loyalty or Customers section where an admin can view customers and their point balances, perhaps adjust points if needed (adjustments might be manual DB edits for MVP unless we add an API for it).

The Customer Service already stores loyalty points in a separate table, but joining that in a customer listing is trivial (or we always use Loyalty Service's API for points).

The Admin UI can list all customers (via Customer Service /customers) and for each show the points (via Loyalty Service). Since that's two calls, we might enhance the Customer Service to join points (it could query loyalty_points as part of its response). Simpler: after loading customers in Admin UI, fire off requests to /loyalty/points?customer_id= for each - not efficient for many customers. Better is to have loyalty points included in Customer model in responses by doing a LEFT JOIN at query time. We can implement that in customer service (since it has access to DB, assuming loyalty_points table is accessible via a foreign key or we give customer-service read access to it).

Redemption Logic Placeholder: MVP might not require using points for purchases, but we should lay groundwork:

Define how redemption would work: e.g., customers can redeem points for discounts or rewards. Not doing it now is okay, but we ensure the data model can support it (which it does, by tracking points).

Possibly add a field in loyalty_points or another table for tracking redemptions or point expiration, but not needed in MVP.

The critical part is to accumulate points now so that when Phase 2 comes and we want to allow spending them, we have historical balances.

Customer Service & Data Privacy: The Customer Service is responsible for storing customer info (distinct from user accounts), and we have it in place (with encryption for PII). We should:

Ensure creating a customer (perhaps via POS or Admin UI) is smooth. This likely involves capturing at least name and phone/email. Customer Service's create_customer already handles encryption and hashing for search. We'll use those endpoints via the UI.

Clarify separation: "users" vs "customers" - documentation and training should highlight that customers are shoppers in CRM/loyalty, whereas users are employees logging into the system. The system design now explicitly has a Customer Service, which addresses the earlier ambiguity and aligns with recommendations.

Integration with External CRM (If any): If MVP decided to integrate with an external loyalty provider instead of an internal one, we would clarify that (e.g., if using a third-party CRM). However, since we implemented our own basic loyalty, we will document that NovaPOS handles loyalty in-house for MVP, which covers the scope item.

Priority: Loyalty integration is important but not as critical as being able to transact. It can be developed once the core selling and admin features are in good shape. The earning of points is already automated by event - what remains is mostly UI work and ensuring the data flows (customer ID on order) is done. We schedule these tasks after payments and returns are done, but before final MVP testing so that the feature is visible to stakeholders (since it was highlighted as a gap earlier). Loyalty is a selling point for engagement, so even a basic implementation will fulfill the promise made in scope.

By implementing loyalty accrual now (simple and visible in UI), we address the MVP "Customer & Loyalty" item clearly. Customers will see points accruing on receipts and staff can lookup balances, demonstrating the feature even if redemption is not live yet.

1. Integration Gateway & External API Integrations

Gaps: We need to clarify and solidify which features are delivered natively vs through integration, and ensure the Integration Gateway covers all needed external interactions. The current Integration Gateway handles Coinbase webhooks and provides an /external/order API for e-commerce to create orders, as well as a unified /payments API for the POS. We will extend and document this gateway as the official external API entry point:

E-commerce Integration (Orders): The MVP's omnichannel requirement is to record online orders and unify inventory. We have POST /external/order which allows an external system (e.g., a Shopify plugin or a custom web checkout) to create an order in NovaPOS. Steps to finalize:

Authentication: External calls use API keys. The Auth Service can generate integration keys (which we have endpoints for). We will generate a key for the e-commerce platform and give it the appropriate rights (likely tied to a role or simply to a tenant). The Integration Gateway's auth middleware already validates X-API-Key and maps it to a tenant.

Document for the client developers (this might be internal documentation) how to call this API: e.g., "Send HTTP POST to /external/order with JSON body like ExternalOrder (same format as POS orders) and include headers: X-Tenant-ID: `yourTenantUUID`, X-API-Key: `providedKey`". We'll note that the API responds with the created order (ID and status).

Possibly provide a reference implementation (like a small script or snippet) to integrate. But in our context, just ensure the contract is clear.

External Inventory Access: If an online store needs to get product info and stock levels (to display on website), we should expose read endpoints:

We can add GET /external/products and /external/inventory on the Integration Gateway that proxy to Product Service and Inventory Service respectively. For example, a GET /external/products could internally GET product-service/products and return the list. The gateway's middleware will ensure the request has a valid integration key and inject X-Tenant-ID as needed.

Alternatively, the e-comm site could call the microservices directly using a JWT or integration key, but that complicates auth for multiple services. The gateway approach centralizes external access and auditing.

We'll implement at least read access to product catalog and inventory via the gateway:

```rust
// Pseudo-code in integration_handlers.rs
pub async fn list_products(State(state): State<AppState>, Extension(tenant_id): Extension<Uuid>) -> Result<Json<Value>, StatusCode> {
   let url = format!("{}:{}/products", state.config.product_service_host, state.config.product_service_port);
   let resp = state.http_client.get(&url)
                        .header("X-Tenant-ID", tenant_id.to_string())
                        .send().await.map_err(|_| StatusCode::BAD_GATEWAY)?;
   if !resp.status().is_success() {
         return Err(StatusCode::BAD_GATEWAY);
   }
   let body = resp.json().await.map_err(|_| StatusCode::BAD_GATEWAY)?;
   Ok(Json(body))
}
```

and similarly for inventory (perhaps combining product and inventory info if needed for convenience).

If security or performance is a concern, we could cache responses or restrict fields. But MVP likely has manageable data sizes.

Integration vs Native Feature Clarity: We explicitly clarify that:

The web storefront is not custom-built in NovaPOS for MVP - instead, NovaPOS provides APIs (as above) for integrating an existing e-commerce platform. For example, a retailer might use Shopify or a simple custom site that calls NovaPOS's APIs for inventory and order posting. We document this to manage expectations: the MVP demonstrates omnichannel by integration, not by a full in-house web store module.

If any other feature is deferred to third-party integration, we note it. E.g., perhaps loyalty could have been external (but we did internal); if certain analytics or marketing features are expected, we might say those can be met via exporting data to other systems for MVP.

Event Webhooks for External Systems: NovaPOS can emit events via Kafka internally, but what if external systems want to know about events (like an ERP or marketing system)? For MVP, we won't implement a full webhook subscription system, but we can accommodate specific needs:

The Integration Gateway could be configured to forward certain internal events to external endpoints. For example, if the client uses an ERP, they might want to receive order.completed events. We could set up a simple webhook: the alerts module in integration-gateway already posts to a security_alert_webhook (likely for rate limit alerts). We could reuse similar logic:

If needed, allow configuring an "order webhook URL" per tenant; then integration-gateway listens on the order.completed topic (similar to loyalty service, it could have a consumer) and for each message, POST it to that URL. This is advanced and possibly not needed for MVP unless a specific integration requires it.

Given time constraints, likely not needed for initial launch, but something to mention as future extensibility if asked.

Integration Key Management: The Auth Service has endpoints to create and revoke integration keys. We should expose that in the Admin Portal so that admins can create API keys for partners (e.g., to give to their e-commerce team). We will:

Add an "API Integrations" page in Admin Portal where an admin can generate a new key (calls POST /tenants/:id/integration-keys which Auth Service provides) and see existing keys (GET /tenants/:id/integration-keys). The Auth Service likely returns the key ID and secret (the secret likely only shown at creation). We display and allow copying of the key.

Provide a revoke option (calls POST /integration-keys/:key_id/revoke).

This ensures that tenants control their integration endpoints access, improving security and audit.

Robustness & Rate Limiting: The Integration Gateway has a rate limiter built-in (with Redis). We should tune this for the expected load (MVP likely low volume, but we configure sane defaults in GatewayConfig). We'll set per-key or per-tenant rate limits to prevent abuse of the external API. The system even alerts on bursts; these alerts should be routed to the security team or admin (via that publish_rate_limit_alert function which sends to Kafka and optionally webhook).

In MVP context, we might not have separate security monitoring, but at least logs will show warnings if someone's key is hammering the API. Admins can then revoke keys if needed.

Monitoring and Metrics: The Integration Gateway gathers metrics (GatewayMetrics). We will ensure these metrics (requests allowed/denied, latency, etc.) feed into our monitoring (maybe via Prometheus, as hinted by a metrics endpoint). This isn't a direct gap, but important for reliability especially when integrating multiple systems.

Priority: Finalizing integration points should happen once core internal features are done, but not too late - we must allow time for the e-commerce side to be tested with NovaPOS. So, after completing returns and loyalty, we focus on polishing the Integration Gateway: add any missing endpoints (products, etc.), test an end-to-end online order scenario (simulate an API call), and document usage for the retailer's web team.

By clarifying integration vs native scope and providing the necessary API endpoints, we ensure stakeholders understand what's included in MVP and how external systems will plug in. The NovaPOS cloud will act as a hub that online and offline channels both connect to, fulfilling the omnichannel capability with minimal custom front-end development on our side.

<{tag_name}>

Conclusion: With the above plan, we address all identified MVP gaps with a structured, prioritized approach. First, we secure the core transaction loop (order creation with idempotency, unified payments, and robust refund handling). Then, we enhance supporting domains: inventory (variants, multi-store, alerts), loyalty (points accrual and display), and security (RBAC, audit). Finally, we refine the integration touch-points for external systems. These additions and adjustments are modular and follow the architecture's existing patterns, so teams can implement them in parallel without high coupling. By closing these gaps, NovaPOS will deliver a complete MVP that meets the scope requirements and is well-prepared for the high-profile launch event, while also establishing a solid foundation for future expansion.
