## 3.1 Detailed Validation Narrative (Status vs Evidence)

Legend: Done = implemented & exercised, Partial = foundations exist but gaps / breadth missing, Missing = no substantive code or only planning docs.

### A. Orders / Offline / Analytics

- Offline order queue & idempotency key generation: Partial (client logic in `OrderContext.tsx` lines ~21‚Äì120 & 918+; lacks server-side reconciliation / conflict resolution).
- Resume & reconciliation jobs (pending‚Üícompleted stall detection): Missing (no background job / cron logic found).
- Duplicate/conflict detection UX (offline replay): Missing (no diff UI components).
- Historical / cohort / multi-day exports: Missing (no analytics export endpoints).
- Server-side replay validation (price/inventory): Missing (no validation layer in order-service referencing inventory delta; only inventory events consuming order topics).

### B. Payments & Gateway

- Physical terminal SDK integration: Missing (no terminal/peripheral code).
- Failure taxonomy / partial approvals / reversals: Missing (no structured enums or retry orchestrations in payment-service).
- Refund & reversal passthrough (card/crypto): Missing (no refund endpoints).
- Idempotency tokens for payment intents: Missing (only frontend idempotency key in orders; no `payment_intent` table).
- Webhook (replay/mutation) hardening: Missing (integration-gateway has API key auth & rateLimiter, but no webhook signature verification beyond Coinbase placeholder).
- Expanded connectors & credential scoping (OAuth2/JWT per connector): Missing (only integration keys in auth-service `tenant_handlers.rs`).
- Partner dashboards & alerting: Missing (no UI pages or routes).

### C. Admin Portal / Management

- User lifecycle (edit/deactivate/role changes): Partial (auth-service tenant & integration key mgmt exists; UI lacks full user admin CRUD).
- Expanded analytics / HQ rollups: Missing.
- Inventory oversight UI (low-stock, adjustments history): Missing (only product list & orders/returns pages).
- Tenant onboarding workflow: Partial (tenant creation in `tenant_handlers.rs`, no provisioning hooks).
- Global audit views: Missing (audit ingestion documented in `security_plan.txt`, no UI).

### D. Security & Compliance

- Central tenancy middleware: Partial (duplicate per-service `tenant_id_from_request`; see analysis doc calling out duplication).
- Consistent RBAC enforcement: Partial (product and customer handlers enforce roles; uneven across all services).
- Unified structured audit pipeline: Partial (design + code fragments for audit producer/consumer in `security_plan.txt`, not fully integrated into services).
- GDPR/retention beyond customer-service: Missing (GDPR operations only in customer-service).
- Network segmentation / ingress hardening: Missing (compose uses flat network; no sidecar/ingress rules).
- Timezone/local-time reporting strategy: Missing (no timezone normalization beyond naive `Utc::now()`).

### E. Inventory

- Per-location inventory model: Done. New tables `locations`, `inventory_items` added via migrations (4003_create_locations.sql, 4004_create_inventory_items_multilocation.sql, 4005_backfill_inventory_items.sql) with dual-write validation logic and aggregated query paths in `inventory_handlers.rs`.
- Reservation lifecycle: Done. Create & release endpoints plus expiration sweeper (periodic task in `main.rs`) enforcing TTL via `expires_at` and emitting both domain (`inventory.reservation.expired`) and audit (`audit.events`) Kafka messages; integration test (`multilocation_lifecycle.rs`) validates restock + events.
- Low-stock alerts & audit: Partial. Emission of `inventory.low_stock` events implemented after order completion when quantity <= threshold. UI surfacing, threshold management UX, and alert tuning still pending.
- Adjustment & transfer APIs: Missing (no routes for manual adjustments or inter-location transfers yet).
- Event dedupe semantics: Missing (no idempotency keys / hash-based suppression on emitted events beyond Kafka topic semantics).

### F. Returns & Exchanges

- Returns initiation UI: Partial (`ReturnsPage.tsx` fetching returns, initiating basic return).
- Policy module (restock fees, condition codes): Missing (no schema for return policies).
- Exchange flow: Done (replacement order delta logic implemented in order-service exchange endpoint; E2E passing in POS/Admin).
- Manager override & audit: Missing.
- Gateway passthrough for original tender reversals: Missing.

### G. Loyalty & Customer Programs

- Points accrual basic read: Done (loyalty-service `/points`, SQL query file).
- Earn accrual on order.completed: Done (loyalty-service handler consumes order.completed and increments points; redemption pending).
- Redemption engine (burn/partial/expiry): Missing.
- Tiering rules & promotion hooks: Missing.
- Offline loyalty balance caching/conflict resolution: Missing.
- Consolidated customer 360 view at POS: Missing (POS does not surface loyalty/ recent orders integrated view; only order state).

### H. POS Edge (Device & Performance)

- Peripheral integrations (scanner/printer/terminal/cash drawer): Missing.
- Large catalog performance optimizations (virtualized grid/search indexing): Missing (no virtualization libs; simple React pages).
- Kiosk lockdown (session pinning, idle policies): Missing.
- Native shell / device mgmt wrappers: Missing.

### I. BOPIS / Fulfillment

- Reservation/promise layer (time-bound): Partial (basic reservation create/release; lacks expiry, SLA).
- Pickup workflow states & reconciliation: Missing (no pickup status model).

### J. Offline Sync Layer

- Conflict detection (price/inventory mismatch) UI: Missing.
- Retry telemetry / monitoring (queue depth, failure reasons): Missing (local storage only).
- Duplicate prevention beyond idempotency (content hash / diff): Missing.

### K. Cross-cutting Architecture

- Metrics endpoint standardization: Done. All services expose `/metrics`; legacy `/internal/metrics` temporarily retained where it existed for backward compatibility. Deprecation window to be scheduled (see Section 8).
- API versioning standard: Missing (no `/v1/` prefixes across all services consistently).
- Standard idempotency header contract: Missing (client-side only, no server spec).
- Saga / compensation orchestration: Missing (no orchestrator/outbox tables; fire-and-forget events).
- Unified timezone/reporting boundary: Missing (duplicate with D).

## 5. Next Sprint Starter Epics (Initial Story Slices)

### Epic: Inventory Multi-Location Foundation

- Design & migration: add `locations`, augment `inventory_items(location_id)`, backfill. ‚Äî ‚úÖ Completed (migrations 4003‚Äì4005 applied; backfill script logic executed during startup/tests).
- Update reservation endpoints to accept `location_id`; add expiration job. ‚Äî ‚úÖ Completed (handlers updated; sweeper task with TTL + audit + restock implemented).
- Publish low-stock event prototype. ‚Äî üåì Implemented event emission to `inventory.low_stock`; pending admin/UI consumption & threshold management tooling.

### Epic: Tenancy & Audit Unification

Status: Phase 1 foundations in place (crate extraction, dual-service adoption, structured event schema, sink abstraction). Search/consumer layer deferred to Phase 2.

Delivered (Phase 1):

- Shared security context crate (`services/common/security`): unified tenant_id, actor, roles, trace propagation.
- Audit event schema v1: event_version, event_id (UUID), severity, source_service, trace_id, payload/meta separation.
- AuditSink abstraction with `KafkaAuditSink` (feature-gated) and `NoopAuditSink` for test isolation.
- Product-service & order-service migrated to `SecurityCtxExtractor` (handlers now enforce roles via `Role` enum; removed legacy per-file constants in order-service; product-service cleanup pending unused legacy helpers removal).
- Audit emissions added for product CRUD and order create/void/refund events.

Pending (Phase 2 / Next Sprints):

- Extend security context usage to remaining services (inventory, loyalty, payment, integration-gateway, customer, auth modernization).
- Implement audit consumer & indexing service (persist to analytical store / searchable index) + REST query (`/audit/events`).
- Role model expansion (distinct Cashier vs Support, granular inventory adjustment roles).
- Redaction & retention policies (sensitive fields masking, TTL jobs) linked to GDPR roadmap.
- Global audit search UI (admin portal) with filters (actor, action, entity, severity, date).
- Cross-service correlation fields (propagate trace_id automatically from incoming request spans).

Risks / Considerations:

- Need to remove remaining legacy role helpers to avoid drift.
- Kafka backpressure & batching strategy (currently synchronous fire-and-forget; move to buffered channel + backpressure metrics).
- Future multi-sink support (e.g., direct OpenSearch sink) can extend `AuditSink` without schema churn.

### Epic: Offline Replay Validation

- Define diff contract (incoming vs authoritative) + conflict codes.
- Order-service validation endpoint (inventory/price checks).
- POS modal for conflict resolution (adjust, override, cancel).

### Epic: Payment Intent & Webhook Hardening

- `payment_intents` table (idempotency_key unique, status enum).
- Intent creation API + state transitions (requires_capture, succeeded, failed, reversed).
- HMAC webhook middleware + delivery log + replay detection.

### Epic: Returns Policy Module (Phase 1)

- `return_policies` schema (restock_fee, condition_codes JSON, approval_threshold).
- Apply policy in return calculation endpoint + UI fee display.
- Audit events on create/update usage.

(Defer: Loyalty, BOPIS, Saga infrastructure until foundations stable.)

## 8. Open Questions / Decisions To Record

- Decision: Standardize metrics on `/metrics` and deprecate `/internal/metrics` aliases.
  - Proposed deprecation window: 1‚Äì2 sprints. Actions: update Prometheus scrape configs and dashboards to `/metrics`, announce in release notes, then remove alias routes.

## 9. Immediate Technical Dependencies / Sequencing Notes

- Inventory multi-location migration should precede reservation expiration logic to avoid dual rewrites.
- Payment intent schema should land before refund/reversal stories to prevent churn.
- Tenancy middleware refactor early reduces duplication before adding more endpoints (returns / exchanges).
- Audit integration should accompany each new mutation endpoint for consistent coverage.
- Offline replay validation depends on inventory normalization (price + availability checks).

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Large inventory schema migration | Downtime / data inconsistency | Shadow tables + phased cutover behind feature flag |
| Middleware refactor regression | Auth / tenancy breaks | Incremental rollout w/ integration tests, canary services |
| Payment intent introduction churn | Double work / partial adoption | Dual-path compatibility for one sprint, telemetry gating |
| Offline validation UX complexity | Delayed adoption | Ship read-only diff first, add override later |
| Lack of audit coverage | Forensics gaps | Establish audit checklist pre-merge |

## 11. Suggested Metrics to Track

- Offline replay conflict rate (% of offline orders needing adjustment).
- Payment intent duplicate rate (should approach zero).
- Average reservation expiration reclaim time.
- Audit coverage ratio (# audited mutating endpoints / total mutating endpoints).
- Inventory stock drift incidents (detected vs resolved).

(Keep small; open items either resolved or promoted to backlog story.)

- Payment failure taxonomy naming (pending workshop).
- Saga framework selection (Temporal vs bespoke outbox + lightweight orchestrator).
- Timezone source of truth (store-level tz vs tenant-level default).
