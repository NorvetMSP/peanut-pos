# NovaPOS Cloud POS Platform — Current Architecture Overview

NovaPOS is a distributed edge/cloud POS platform designed for multi-tenant SaaS. Stores run an offline-capable POS Edge Client, while cloud microservices (Rust, containerized) provide core business functions. Components are decoupled with events over Kafka and secured end-to-end for tenant isolation.

## System architecture overview

- Edge clients (React PWA) operate offline and sync when connectivity resumes.
- Cloud services (Rust) run in containers/orchestrators (Docker/Kubernetes).
- Asynchronous events on Kafka decouple workflows; REST handles synchronous calls.
- Strict multi-tenancy with tenant-scoped data and request validation.

When an order is voided, the Order Service emits an `order.voided` event for other services to consume instead of making direct calls. Similar topics like `order.completed` and `payment.completed` propagate state changes without tight coupling.

Requests must include an `X-Tenant-ID` header that matches the user’s JWT claims. All records carry a tenant identifier to ensure isolation.

## Edge POS and offline mode

The POS Edge Client is a React web app (tablet/kiosk friendly) deployed per store. It supports scanning, carts, payments, and receipt printing with a touch-first UX.

### Key capabilities

- Offline-first caching of catalog, pricing, and tax rules (IndexedDB/localStorage).
- Local transaction queue with idempotency keys; syncs to Order Service when online.
- Deferred updates: catalog/price changes apply on reconnection.
- Secure transport: TLS everywhere and device authentication.

Note: While syncing, the UI may show cached receipt data until cloud confirmation, leading to small, later-reconciled differences.

## Cloud backend and microservices

Containerized Rust services are deployable to Kubernetes or Docker Compose.

### Core services

- [Auth Service](../../services/auth-service/)
- [Product Service](../../services/product-service/)
- [Inventory Service](../../services/inventory-service/)
- [Order Service](../../services/order-service/)
- [Payment Service](../../services/payment-service/)
- [Integration Gateway](../../services/integration-gateway/)
- [Customer Service](../../services/customer-service/)
- [Loyalty Service](../../services/loyalty-service/)
- [Analytics Service](../../services/analytics-service/)

### Architecture highlights

- REST APIs today; GraphQL planned.
- Kafka for async events; REST for synchronous paths (e.g., Order → Inventory reservation).
- Multi-tenant PostgreSQL with `tenant_id` for row-level isolation.
- Shared infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Zookeeper, Vault.
- IaC with Terraform for AWS deployments.
- Independent deployability with health endpoints and observability.

## Multi-tenancy and data isolation

NovaPOS is built as a true multi-tenant SaaS with isolation at multiple layers.

### Enforcement layers

- Database: `tenant_id` on every table, tenant-scoped indexes.
- Application: `X-Tenant-ID` header + JWT claim validation via `SecurityCtxExtractor`.
- RBAC: roles (cashier, manager, admin) control UI and API privileges.
- Encryption: tenant-specific keys (envelope encryption via Vault).

This ensures both logical isolation (tenant-scoped queries) and cryptographic protection (per-tenant encryption).

## Secure integration and omnichannel

The Integration Gateway acts as a secure façade for partner APIs and omnichannel flows.

### Capabilities

- Handles inbound/outbound APIs and webhooks (e-commerce, payment gateways).
- API keys or OAuth tokens, rate limiting (Redis), and HMAC signature checks.
- HTTPS everywhere; all integration traffic is audited.

Typical scenarios:

- Online orders → in-store inventory sync.
- Daily sales → accounting systems.
- Loyalty data → marketing platforms.

## AI and analytics stack

The Analytics & AI Service (port `8082`) consumes transactional and inventory events to power insights.

### Current functionality

- Aggregations: sales summaries, top sellers.
- Early AI: anomaly detection (e.g., refund spikes) and trend forecasting.
- Roadmap: demand forecasting, stock optimization, ML model integration.

Architecture is ready to offload to an analytical store or warehouse (e.g., BigQuery). Data is isolated per tenant and can be anonymized for cross-tenant learning.

## Components

### 1. POS Edge Client (frontend)

- React PWA optimized for touchscreen.
- Works offline (IndexedDB + local queue).
- Uses JWT + `X-Tenant-ID` for secure API calls.
- Prints receipts; payment terminal integration planned.
- Idempotency prevents duplicate orders during resync.

### 2. Back-office Admin Portal

- React web app (port `3001`) for management tasks.
- Features:
  - Product and inventory CRUD.
  - User management with role enforcement.
  - Order/return workflows.
  - Integration settings (API keys, tax rules).
  - Dashboards with analytics and alerts.
- Auth: JWT; routes guarded by role (e.g., `RequireRoles(["admin"])`).

### 3. Authentication and User Service (Auth Service)

- Port `8085`.
- Manages users, tenants, roles.
- Issues JWTs (RS256) with claims: `sub`, `tid`, `roles`.
- MFA (TOTP) for managers/admins.
- JWKS endpoint for token validation.
- API keys for external integrations.
- Comprehensive auth logging and audit.

### 4. Product and Inventory Services

- Product Service (port `8081`): catalog CRUD, audit logs, price/tax data.
- Inventory Service (port `8087`): stock tracking, reservations, low-stock alerts.
- Shared money library for consistent rounding.
- Emits events like `product.updated`, `inventory.low_stock`.
- Supports multi-location inventory and a reservation TTL sweeper.

### 5. Order and Transaction Service

- Port `8084`.
- Manages orders, refunds, and voids.
- Responsibilities:
  - Validate and compute order totals.
  - Reserve inventory.
  - Initiate payments.
  - Generate receipts.
- Enforces idempotency to prevent duplicates.
- Consumes/publishes payment status via Kafka (e.g., `payment.completed`).
- Emits events for Inventory and Loyalty.
- Supports refunds/voids; automation via integrations is planned.

### 6. Payment Services

- Payment Service (port `8086`): handles card transactions (currently stubbed).
- Integration Gateway (port `8083`): manages crypto via Coinbase Commerce.

Card payments:

- Placeholder for Valor PayTech terminal integration.
- Simulated approval workflow for MVP (no PAN/CVV stored).
- Future support: EMV, tap, signature capture.

Crypto payments:

- Integrates with Coinbase Commerce.
- Creates charge, receives webhook, publishes `payment.completed` to Kafka.
- Supports USDC and confirms blockchain transactions.
- Secrets in Vault; minimal PCI scope.

### 7. Customer and Loyalty Services

- Customer Service (port `8089`):
  - Stores encrypted PII (per-tenant keys).
  - CRUD and GDPR endpoints.
- Loyalty Service (port `8088`):
  - Tracks points earned/redeemed.
  - Consumes `order.completed` events.
  - Manual adjustments and redemption API (in progress).
- Async by design: sales complete even if Loyalty is temporarily offline.
- Planned: tiering, offline caching, CRM integration.

### 8. Reporting and audit logging

- Common audit library produces Kafka `audit.events`.
- Append-only audit log planned for centralized persistence.
- Operational reporting via Order/Analytics APIs.
- Monitoring:
  - Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
  - Structured JSON logs.
  - `trace_id` correlation across services.
- Planned: dedicated reporting + immutable audit microservice.

## Data flows

### Checkout (card)

1. POS Edge creates order draft locally; on submit, sends to Order Service (REST, JWT + `X-Tenant-ID`).
2. Order Service validates, computes totals, reserves inventory (sync call to Inventory).
3. Order Service initiates payment via Payment Service.
4. Payment Service authorizes (stub/terminal); publishes `payment.completed` (Kafka).
5. Order Service marks order complete and publishes `order.completed` (Kafka).
6. Inventory consumes `order.completed` and finalizes stock changes; Loyalty accrues points.

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant POS as POS Edge
  participant ORD as Order Service
  participant INV as Inventory
  participant PAY as Payment Service
  participant K as Kafka
  participant LOY as Loyalty

  POS->>ORD: Create/submit order (REST, JWT + X-Tenant-ID)
  ORD->>INV: Reserve stock (REST)
  INV-->>ORD: Reservation OK
  ORD->>PAY: Initiate payment (REST)
  PAY-->>K: payment.completed
  K-->>ORD: payment.completed
  ORD-->>K: order.completed
  K-->>INV: order.completed
  K-->>LOY: order.completed
```

Legend: Solid arrows show requests; `-->>` indicates messages/events; K represents Kafka topics; step numbers are for readability.

### Refund

1. Admin Portal requests refund to Order Service (REST).
2. Order Service validates policy and publishes `order.voided` or `order.refunded` (Kafka).
3. Payment Service processes reversal; emits `payment.completed` (Kafka) with refund metadata.
4. Inventory and Analytics consume events for stock and reporting updates.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' }}%%
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant ADMIN as Admin Portal
  participant ORD as Order Service
  participant PAY as Payment Service
  participant K as Kafka
  participant INV as Inventory
  participant ANA as Analytics

  ADMIN->>ORD: Request refund (REST)
  ORD-->>K: order.refunded / order.voided
  ORD->>PAY: Initiate reversal (REST)
  PAY-->>K: payment.completed (refund)
  K-->>INV: order.refunded / order.voided
  K-->>ANA: order.refunded / payment.completed
```

Legend: Admin initiates via REST; Order emits `order.refunded`/`order.voided`; Payment emits `payment.completed (refund)`; Inventory/Analytics consume events.

### Crypto payment (Coinbase Commerce)

1. POS Edge selects crypto; Order Service asks Integration Gateway to create a charge.
2. Shopper completes payment; Coinbase sends webhook to Integration Gateway.
3. Integration Gateway verifies HMAC, then publishes `payment.completed` (Kafka).
4. Order Service consumes `payment.completed`, completes the order, emits `order.completed`.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' }}%%
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant POS as POS Edge
  participant ORD as Order Service
  participant IGW as Integration Gateway
  participant CB as Coinbase Commerce
  participant K as Kafka

  POS->>ORD: Start crypto checkout (REST)
  ORD->>IGW: Create charge (REST)
  IGW->>CB: Create charge (API)
  CB-->>IGW: Webhook (payment confirmed)
  IGW->>IGW: Verify HMAC signature
  IGW-->>K: payment.completed (crypto)
  K-->>ORD: payment.completed
  ORD-->>K: order.completed
```

## Entity relationships by bounded context

### Order context

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' }}%%
classDiagram
  class Tenant {
    +uuid id
    +string name
  }
  class Order {
    +uuid id
    +uuid tenant_id
    +uuid customer_id
    +Money total
    +OrderStatus status
  }
  class OrderLine {
    +uuid id
    +uuid order_id
    +uuid product_id
    +int qty
    +Money unit_price
  }
  class Payment {
    +uuid id
    +uuid order_id
    +string method
    +Money amount
    +PaymentStatus status
  }
  Tenant <|-- Order
  Order "1" -- "*" OrderLine
  Order "1" -- "*" Payment
  OrderLine ..> Product : product_id
```

Legend: `<|--` indicates tenant scoping; `1--*` shows cardinality; dotted `..>` shows a reference to an external context (Product).

### Product context

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' }}%%
classDiagram
  class Tenant {
    +uuid id
    +string name
  }
  class Product {
    +uuid id
    +uuid tenant_id
    +string name
    +Money price
  }
  class InventoryItem {
    +uuid id
    +uuid tenant_id
    +uuid product_id
    +int on_hand
    +int reserved
    +string location_id
  }
  Tenant <|-- Product
  Tenant <|-- InventoryItem
  Product "1" -- "*" InventoryItem
```

Legend: Inventory is per-product and per-location; fields simplified (pricing/tax rules omitted for clarity).

### Customer and Loyalty context

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' }}%%
classDiagram
  class Tenant {
    +uuid id
    +string name
  }
  class Customer {
    +uuid id
    +uuid tenant_id
    +PII encrypted_fields
  }
  class LoyaltyAccount {
    +uuid id
    +uuid customer_id
    +int points
  }
  Tenant <|-- Customer
  Customer "1" -- "0..1" LoyaltyAccount
```

Legend: Customer PII is encrypted; loyalty account is optional and belongs to a single customer.

Addendum: Engineering Findings (2025-10-07)

This section summarizes the current implementation as observed in the repository and highlights gaps from the prior PDF overview. It is additive and does not replace or remove the original content above.

System Overview
- Edge + Cloud: React frontends (POS and Admin) connect to a Rust microservice backend.
- Multi-tenant: All business data is tenant-scoped; requests include `X-Tenant-ID` and JWT claims enforce tenancy.
- Event-driven: Kafka decouples workflows (e.g., `order.completed`, `payment.completed`).
- Deployability: Docker Compose for dev; Terraform for AWS; Vault/Redis/Postgres/Kafka included.

Frontends
- POS Edge Client (`frontends/pos-app`)
  - Offline-first PWA using `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox caching.
  - Product catalog cached per-tenant in `localStorage`; offline order queue with idempotency keys.
  - Communicates with `order-service` and `integration-gateway` via REST; polls for status (WebSocket URL scaffolded but backend WS not implemented).
- Admin Portal (`frontends/admin-portal`)
  - React + Vite with simple RBAC (`rbac.ts`), pages for Products, Orders, Users, Settings, and Reporting.
  - Uses JWT from `auth-service` and `X-Tenant-ID` for admin operations.

Microservices (Rust)
- Auth Service (`services/auth-service`, port 8085)
  - JWT issuance/verification; JWKS endpoint; MFA hooks; integration keys.
  - Emits security activity events (e.g., `security.mfa.activity`).
  - Vault integration in entrypoint to load secrets.
- Product Service (`services/product-service`, port 8081)
  - CRUD for products; audit event emission; Prometheus metrics at `/internal/metrics`.
  - Emits `product.created`.
- Inventory Service (`services/inventory-service`, port 8087)
  - Stock, locations, and reservations (multi-location supported). Consumes `order.completed`, `order.voided`, `payment.completed`, `product.created`.
  - Emits `inventory.low_stock` and audit events.
- Order Service (`services/order-service`, port 8084)
  - Order lifecycle (including exchanges/returns and idempotency), settlement reporting, tax-rate overrides.
  - Consumes `payment.completed`; emits `order.completed`, `order.voided`.
- Payment Service (`services/payment-service`, port 8086)
  - Payment flows and auditing; typically fronted by the Integration Gateway.
- Integration Gateway (`services/integration-gateway`, port 8083)
  - API-key usage, request validation, rate limiting via Redis, webhook handlers.
  - Emits `payment.completed`; writes usage records; integrates with Vault in entrypoint.
- Customer Service (`services/customer-service`, port 8089)
  - PII encryption per-tenant using data-encryption keys (DEKs) protected by a master key.
  - GDPR delete/export flows; Prometheus metrics at `/internal/metrics`.
- Loyalty Service (`services/loyalty-service`, port 8088)
  - Consumes `order.completed`; emits `loyalty.events`.
- Analytics Service (`services/analytics-service`, port 8082)
  - Consumes `order.completed`/`inventory.low_stock`; exposes health and metrics endpoints.
- Supporting: `audit-consumer` (debug/validation), `common/*` crates for auth, security, audit, observability, money, crypto.

Data & Multi-tenancy
- Single Postgres instance (dev) with service-scoped tables; every business table includes `tenant_id` and tenant indexes (e.g., `products(tenant_id)`).
- Tenancy enforcement via shared guards validates `X-Tenant-ID` against JWT claims.
- Customer PII uses per-tenant DEKs stored in DB; encrypted with a master key (`MasterKey`).

Messaging (Kafka Topics)
- Orders: `order.completed`, `order.voided`.
- Payments: `payment.completed` (and `payment.failed` consumption in Order Service).
- Products: `product.created`.
- Inventory: `inventory.low_stock`, `inventory.reservation.expired` (audit).
- Audit/Security: `audit.events`, `security.mfa.activity`, `security.alerts.v1`.
- Loyalty: `loyalty.events`.

Infrastructure & Runtime
- Docker Compose (dev): Postgres (5432), Redis (6379), Zookeeper (2181), Kafka (9092), Vault (8200), plus all services on their listed ports.
- Terraform (AWS) under `infra/terraform/dev`.
- Secrets: Vault entrypoints used for Auth and Integration Gateway; other services use env vars in dev.

Observability
- Health: `/healthz` on most services.
- Metrics: `/metrics` or `/internal/metrics` depending on service.
- Grafana/Prometheus configs under `monitoring/`; dashboards for Integration Gateway; alerts samples included.

Security Overview
- Auth: JWT with role/capability checks (`common_security`) and tenant guard.
- Tenancy: Required `X-Tenant-ID` header; validated against JWT tenant claim.
- Data protection: Per-tenant encryption for Customer PII; audit logging across domain actions.
- Rate limiting: Redis-backed limiter in Integration Gateway.
- TLS: Expected at the edge (reverse proxy/ingress) in production; local dev uses HTTP in Compose.

Gaps and Alignment Notes (vs. prior PDF)
- Device authentication: Not yet implemented server-side; client maintains a device identifier for offline idempotency, but backend auth is user/JWT-based. Treat device auth as a future enhancement.
- WebSocket order status: POS client scaffolds `ws://�/ws/orders`, but no WS endpoint exists in services; current implementation polls for status.
- Vault adoption: Auth and Integration Gateway use Vault at startup; other services currently rely on env vars in dev. Expand Vault usage for parity.
- TLS in dev: PDF implies TLS end-to-end; Compose uses HTTP for convenience. Production should terminate TLS at ingress/reverse proxy.
- GraphQL: Not implemented; REST-only today.
- Metrics path inconsistency: Some services use `/metrics`, others `/internal/metrics`. Consider standardizing.

Appendix: Dev Ports (docker-compose.yml)
- Product 8081, Analytics 8082, Integration Gateway 8083, Order 8084, Auth 8085, Payment 8086, Inventory 8087, Loyalty 8088, Customer 8089.
- Platform: Postgres 5432, Redis 6379, Kafka 9092, Zookeeper 2181, Vault 8200.
